## 5. Mining

Mining is one of the most important parts of the economy in this bot. You mine for emeralds, the main currency and items, which can be collected! To mine, you use the `!!mine` command or its aliases, `!!eun` and `!!mein`.

### Cooldown

The command has a two second cooldown. Cooldown is affected by haste potions and efficiency books.

|      Item           | Change in cooldown |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Haste 1 Potion      | 0.5s (Duration: 6m)|
| Haste 2 Potion      | 1s (Duration: 4.5m)|
| Efficiency I Book   | 0.5s (Permanent)   |

### Pickaxes

Pickaxes are essential to mining. Each level of pickaxe increases the chance of finding emeralds when mining.

| Pickaxe   | Chance |
|-----------|--------|
| Wood      |  15%   |
| Stone     |  19%   |
| Iron      |  26%   |
| Gold      |  30%   |
| Diamond   |  38%   |
| Netherite |  50%   |

### Emerald drops

Fortune books increase the amount of emeralds you can get per mine.

| Book      | Increase |
|-----------|----------|
| Fortune 1 | 66%: 1   |
|           | 33%: 2   |
| Fortune 2 | 60%: 1   |
|           | 20%: 2   |
|           | 20%: 3   |
| Fortune 3 | 40%: 1   |
|           | 20%: 2   |
|           | 20%: 3   |
|           | 20%: 4   |

### Trash

While mining, you will encounter "trash" items, including cobblestone, iron, gold and diamond. These drops are inconsequential to the bot as villagers only care about emeralds, but you can sieve through the trash to find some extra emeralds by using `!!trash`. The amount of emeralds you find can be influenced by the Rich Person Trophy (bought from the shop), and the Recycler, which can be found as a 1/50,000 drop while mining. Both of these items double your findings from digging around the trash.

### Buffs

Other items which also influence your emerald yield:

- Bane Of Pillagers Amulet: adds 2 more emeralds to your base yield.
- Rich Person Trophy: doubles your yield.

Mobs can spawn when you mine! Read about them [here](6-mobs.md).
