## 5. Mining

Mining is one of the most important parts of the economy in this bot. You mine for emeralds, the main currency and items, which can be collected! To mine, you use the `!!mine` command or its aliases, `!!eun` and `!!mein`.

### Cooldown 

The command has a two second cooldown. Cooldown is affected by haste potions and efficiency books.

|      Item           | Change in cooldown |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Haste 1 Potion      | 0.5s (Duration: 6m)|
| Haste 2 Potion      | 1s (Duration: 4.5m)|
| Efficiency I Book   | 0.5s (Permanent)   |

### Pickaxes

Pickaxes are essential to mining. Each level of pickaxe increases the chance of finding emeralds when mining.

| Pickaxe   | Chance |
|-----------|--------|
| Wood      |  15%   |
| Stone     |  19%   |
| Iron      |  26%   |
| Gold      |  30%   |
| Diamond   |  38%   |
| Netherite |  50%   |

### Emerald drops

Fortune books increase the amount of emeralds you can get per mine.

| Book      | Increase |
|-----------|----------|
| Fortune 1 | 66%: 1   |
|           | 33%: 2   |
| Fortune 2 | 60%: 1   |
|           | 20%: 2   |
|           | 20%: 3   |
| Fortune 3 | 40%: 1   |
|           | 20%: 2   |
|           | 20%: 3   |
|           | 20%: 4   |
