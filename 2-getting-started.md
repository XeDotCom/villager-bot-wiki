## 2. Getting Started With The Bot

### Step 1: Invite the bot

 (This step requires you having a server and/or you having Manage Server permission)

 Invite the bot to your server using [this link](https://top.gg/bot/639498607632056321/invite). This will take you to a page asking for the permissions required for the bot to work in your server. Check all the permissions required and complete the verification to add the bot to your server.

### Step 2: Basic Configuration (optional)

```
DISCLAIMER:

The prefix used in this wiki / guide is the default prefix for Villager Bot. This may not be the prefix used in your server, make sure to ask your server administrator first or mention @Villager Bot to find the correct prefix.

```

 You can do some basic configuration to personalize the bot for your server. All configuration setup is done through the `!!config` command.

- Changing the prefix: `!!config prefix <new prefix here>`

  Example: `!!config prefix /` (changes the prefix to /)

- Setting the default Minecraft server: `!!config mcserver <IP of server>`

  This is related to the (`!!mcserver`)[mcserver.md] command.
  Example: `!!config mcserver hypixel.net`

- Changing the language: `!!config language <language code>`

  The bot is currently available in Spanish (es), French (fr), Portugese (pt) and English(US) (en). Other langauges are currently being implemented. 
  Example: `!!config language es` (changes the language to Spanish! Â¡hola!)

  You're all set up!
