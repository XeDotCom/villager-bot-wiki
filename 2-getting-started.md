## 2. Getting Started With The Bot 
 
### Step 1: Invite the bot.
 (This step requires you having a server and/or you having Manage Server permission)
 
 Invite the bot to your server using [this link](https://top.gg/bot/639498607632056321/invite). This will take you to a page asking for the permissions required for the bot to work in your server. Check all the permissions required and complete the verification to add the bot to your server.

### Step 2: Basic Configuration (optional)
 
 You can do some basic configuration to personalize the bot for your server. All configuration setup is done through the `!!config` command. 
 
- Changing the prefix: `!!config prefix <new prefix here>`
 
  Example: `!!config prefix /` (changes the prefix to /)
 
- Setting the default Minecraft server: `!!config mcserver <IP of server>`
 
  This is related to the (`!!mcserver`)[mcserver.md] command. 
  Example: `!!config mcserver hypixel.net`
 
- Changing the language: `!!config language <language code>`
 
  The bot is currently only available in Spanish (es) and English(US) (en-us).
  Example: `!!config language es` (changes the language to Spanish! Â¡hola!)
  
  You're all set up!
