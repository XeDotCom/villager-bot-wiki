## 7. The Villager Shop

The Villager Shop is one of the most important aspects of the bot. It is where you buy tools, basic enchantments and other items. You can access the shop with `!!shop`

### Tools
You can buy better pickaxes, better swords and fishing rods from the tools section. The fishing rod is used to fish, the pickaxes are used to mine and the swords are used to fight mobs.

### Magic
You can buy Fortune books, Sharpness books, Haste potions and Vault potions (used to expand your vault).

### Other
You can buy jars of bees (used to get honey, necessary for `!!honey`), netherite scraps (used to buy netherite tools), a Rich Person Trophy (increases gambling multiplier, doubles emeralds from mining, **will wipe your progress**, acts as a prestige), and a Slime Trophy (doubles accuracy against baby slimes).

### Fish
