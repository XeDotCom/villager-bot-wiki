## Fishing

Yup. Villager Bot has fishing. Fishing is one of the newest additions to Villager Bot. You can fish by using the `!!fish` command.

### The Hook

Fishing requires a fishing rod which you can buy from [the shop](7-shop.md). When you fish, you have to wait for a random amount of time before you actually catch a fish, just like real life. It can take around 8 to 20 seconds before a bite. The delay can be decreased using a Lure I Book, which decreases the delay by 3 seconds, or by smoking a piece of Seaweed, which decreases the wait time by 2 seconds for 2 minutes.

### The Bite

When you feel that tug and reel it in, it could be a junk item or a fish.
You can find 5 varieties of fish (rarity is a number which affects how common fish drop, 0 being most common and 5 being least common):

| Fish          | Rarity |
|---------------|--------|
| Cod           | 0      |
| Salmon        | 0      |
| Tropical Fish | 1      |
| Pufferfish    | 3      |
| Rainbow Trout | 4      |
| Gold fish     | 4      |
| Emerald fish  | 5      |

You can also find special items while fishing:

|       Item       | Rarity |  Purpose  |

| Lure I Book | 200 | Reduces cooldown. |
| Rusty Fishing Hook | 999 | Collectible. |
