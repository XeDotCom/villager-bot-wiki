### The Hook

Fishing requires a fishing rod which you can buy from [the shop](7-shop.md). When you fish, you have to wait for a random amount of time before you actually catch a fish, just like real life. It can take around 12 to 32 seconds before a bite. The delay can be decreased using a Lure I Book, which decreases the delay by 4 seconds, or by smoking a piece of Seaweed, which decreases the wait time by an additional 4 seconds for 2 minutes.

### The Bite

When you feel that tug and reel it in, it could be a junk item or a fish.
You can find 5 varieties of fish (rarity is a number which affects how common fish drop, 0 being most common and 5 being least common):

| Fish          | Rarity |
|---------------|--------|
| Cod           | 0      |
| Salmon        | 0      |
| Tropical Fish | 1      |
| Pufferfish    | 3      |
| Rainbow Trout | 4      |
| Gold fish     | 4      |
| Emerald fish  | 5      |

You can also find special items while fishing:

|       Item         | Rarity |  Purpose                              |

| Lure I Book        | 200    | Reduces cooldown.                     |
| Rusty Fishing Hook | 999    | Collectible.                          |
| Seaweed            | 6669   | Reduces cooldown.                     |
| Heart Of The Sea   | 6669   | Can be used to craft Fishing Trophies |

### The Sinker

The price of fish changes every 12 hours, which means you can get either a better deal on your fish or a worse one. The change of the price of fish is different for each fish:

|      Fish        | Change in price |
|------------------|-----------------|
|      Cod         |      2-15       |
|     Salmon       |      10-40      |
|  Tropical Fish   |     30-120      |
|   Pufferfish     |     60-200      |
|   Rainbow Trout  |     180-290     |
|    Gold Fish     |     200-300     |
|   Emerald Fish   |     600-800     |


Tropical fish are the most profitable, as they are relatively common but have prices that reach the 100s quite often.
