## Fishing

Yup. Villager Bot has fishing. Fishing is one of the newest additions to Villager Bot. You can fish by using the `!!fish` command.

### The ___ (lack of good word)

Fishing requires a fishing rod which you can buy from [the shop](7-shop.md). When you fish, you have to wait for a random amount of time before you actually catch a fish, just like real life. You take around 8 to 20 seconds before a bite. The delay can be decreased using a Lure I book, which decreases the delay by 3 seconds. 

### The bite

When you feeel that tug and reel it in, it could be a junk item or a fish.
You can find 5 varieties of fish.
