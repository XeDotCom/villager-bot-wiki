## 9. Farming

### just like stardew valley (not really lol)

Farming is one of the newest additions to Villager Bot, and is a passive income system. Your farm can be accessed by using `!!farm`.

### How to start Farming

To start farming you need seeds and a hoe, both of which can be bought from the [Villager Shop](7-shop.md). Hoes increase the plantable area you have, while seeds are, well seeds.

To plant seeds you can run `!!farm plant [seed]`, while having the respective seed in your inventory.

|    Hoe    | Plot Size |
|-----------|-----------|
|   Wood    | 10 crops  |
|   Stone   | 20 crops  |
|   Iron    | 30 crops  |
|   Gold    | 40 crops  |
|  Diamond  | 50 crops  |
| Netherite | 60 crops  |

### Growth Times

The length of time it takes each seed to become harvestable varies according to the seed.

|      Crop    |   Time   |
|--------------|----------|
| Chorus Fruit | 1 day    |
|    Melon     | 16 hours |
|   Potato     | 12 hours |
|   Carrot     | 6 hours  |
|    Wheat     | 1 hour   |

The time needed for growth can be skipped by using a Bone Meal item, which can only be found from mining and fishing, and is a 1/50,000 drop. Make sure to use it wisely!

### Cultivation

To cultivate your fully grown plants, use the command `!!farm harvest`. The amount of crops you get is affected by the amount of Jar of Bees you own, and will give you ~6 extra crops per harvest at 1 million bees.

### Profitability

The personal opinion of the author is that melons are the most profitable as they are low cost but they give you more money than chorus seeds per seed planted.
