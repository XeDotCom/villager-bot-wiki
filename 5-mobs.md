## 5. Mobs 

Mobs spawn naturally while mining. They spawn randomly every 40 mines. They are a very good source of emeralds.

You can attack a mob by typing `attack`, `atk`, `bonk`, `punch`, or `hit`.

A mob deals a random damage between 2 and 6.

Swords are used to deal damage to mobs. Different swords deal different damage. 

| Sword      | Damage |
|------------|--------|
| Wood       | 1-2HP  |
| Stone      | 1-3HP  |
| Iron       | 2-4HP  |
| Gold       | 4-5HP  |
| Diamond    | 6-7HP  |
| Netherite  | 7-10HP |

The Sharpness enchantment increases damage caused to mobs.

|    Level    | Increase |
|-------------|----------|
| Sharpness 1 |  1.25x   |
| Sharpness 2 |  1.5x    |

Slimes are a different type of mob. Unlike other mobs, for the first two attacks, the slime is invincible. After the second attack, there is a 1/3 chance of your attack dealing damage to the mob. Slimes drop slimeballs, which can be used to buy the slime trophy, which doubles your accuracy against slimes.

After the mob dies, it drops emeralds. The amount of emeralds dropped are based on two variables: difficulty and the amount of emeralds in your pocket. The drops max out if there is more than 256 emeralds in your pocket. Its calculated using this equation:

Looting books increase the amount of emeralds dropped.

|   Level   | Increase |
|-----------|----------|
| Looting 1 |  1.25x   |
| Looting 2 |  1.75x   |

The max amount of emeralds you can get from a mob is 766, if you're on hard difficulty and have a Looting 2 book and have more than 256 emeralds in your pocket.
