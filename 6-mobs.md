## 5. Mobs

Mobs spawn naturally while mining. They spawn randomly every 40 mines. They are a very good source of emeralds.

You can attack a mob by typing `attack`, `fight`, `punch`, `atk`, `kill`, `kil`, `atack`, `stab`, `stabb`, or `bonk`.

If you ever need to flee from a mob because of low health, you can type one of the following: `flee`, `run`, `iamababy`, `run away`, `i am a baby`, or `mommy`.

### Health and Damage
A user has a total of 20 HP. A mob deals a random damage between 2 and 6. To replenish health, the user can use honey jars. Each honey jar heals 1 HP.

Swords are used to deal damage to mobs. Different swords deal different damage.

| Sword      | Damage |
|------------|--------|
| Wood       | 1-2HP  |
| Stone      | 1-3HP  |
| Iron       | 2-4HP  |
| Gold       | 4-5HP  |
| Diamond    | 6-7HP  |
| Netherite  | 7-10HP |

The Sharpness enchantment increases damage caused to mobs.

|    Level    | Increase |
|-------------|----------|
| Sharpness 1 |  1.25x   |
| Sharpness 2 |  1.5x    |

### Baby Slimes
Slimes are a different type of mob. Unlike other mobs, the slime is invincible for the first two attacks. After the second attack, there is a 1/3 chance of your attack dealing damage to the mob. Slimes drop slimeballs, which can be used to buy the slime trophy, which doubles your accuracy against slimes.

### Mob drops

After the mob dies, it drops emeralds. The amount of emeralds dropped are based on two variables: difficulty and the amount of emeralds in your pocket. The drops max out if there is more than 256 emeralds in your pocket. It's calculated like this:

**In easy mode:** If the user's balance is less than 256, the amount of emeralds dropped is `balance * 1/random(3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4)`. If the user's balance is more than 256, the amount of emeralds dropped is `512 * 1/random(3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4)`. This leads to a maximum of 170 emeralds, barring enchantments.

**In hard mode:** If the user's balance is less than 256, the amount of emeralds dropped is `balance * 1/random(1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5)`. If the user's balance is more than 256, the amount of emeralds dropped is `512 * 1/random(1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5)`. This leads to a maximum of 292 emeralds, barring enchantments.

Looting books increase the amount of emeralds dropped.

|   Level   | Increase |
|-----------|----------|
| Looting 1 |  1.25x   |
| Looting 2 |  1.75x   |

The max amount of emeralds you can get from a mob is 766. This is only if you're on hard difficulty, have a Looting 2 book, and have more than 256 emeralds in your pocket.
