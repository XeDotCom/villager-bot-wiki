## 4. Economy 101

Villager Bot has a very solid economy system. This system is solely based on emeralds (hmmrhhrgh). This page brifely goes through the economy system.

### Best way to get emeralds?

- [Mining](5-mining.md). Mining gets you between 1 and 14 emeralds per command. You can also sieve through the trash you collect while mining to find some extra emeralds. 
- Collecting honey. Doing the `!!honey` command (every 24 hours) gets you an amount of honey jars related to the amount of bees you have. The amount of honey jars collected is capped at 1024 jars of bees.
- Trading. Arguably this is the best way to get emeralds, as collectible items can go for upwards of 50000 emeralds! Join the [support server](https://discord.gg/39DwwUV) to trade your items with more people!
- Searching. Using the `/search` command, also known as `/beg`, allows you to search for emeralds (every 30 minutes). However, there is a small chance that you lose emeralds.
- [Fishing](8-fishing.md). Fishing is one of the most profitable methods although it is slower than mining. 
- [Farming](9-farming.md). Farming is the best passive income method for players who have a disposable income ready and doesn't want to spend time mining or fishing.

### Your balance

You can do `!!balance` to find out how many emeralds you have. The command returns an embed with 3 values:

- Vault: this is the amount of emerald blocks in your vault. The emeralds in your vault cannot be used or pillaged, or will be counted towards mob drop calculations, unlike your pocket.
- Pocket: this is the amount of emeralds you can use right now.
- Net worth: this is the sum of the value of all the items in your inventory alongside your balance.
