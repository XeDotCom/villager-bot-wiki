## 4. Economy 101

Villager Bot has a very solid economy system. This system is solely based on emeralds (hmmrhhrgh). This page brifely goes through the economy system.

### How can I get emeralds?

- [Mining](5-mining.md). Mining gets you between 1 and 14 emeralds per command. 
- Collecting honey. Doing the `!!honey` command (every 24 hours) gets you an amount of honey jars related to the amount of bees you have. The amount of honey jars collected is capped at 1024 jars of bees. 
- Trading. Arguably this is the best way to get emeralds, as collectible items can go for upwards of 50000 emeralds! Join the [support server](https://discord.gg/39DwwUV) to trade your items with more people!
- Searching. Using the `/search` command, also known as `/beg`, allows you to search for emeralds (every 30 minutes). However, there is a small chance that you lose emeralds.
