## 4. Economy 101

Villager Bot has a very solid economy system, based on emeralds (yay!). This page brifely goes through the economy system.

### How to get emeralds?

- [Mining](5-mining.md). Mining gets you between 1 and 14 emeralds per command. 
- Collecting honey. Doing the /honey command gets you an amount of honey jars related to the amount of bees you have. The amount of honey jars collected is capped at 1024 bees. 
- Trading. Arguably this is the best way to get emeralds, as collectible items can go for upwards of 50000 emeralds! Join the support server to trade your items as well!
